# NARE - Not A Rule Engine

NARE is a variation over the Specification pattern, as described by Eric Evans & Martin Fowler here: https://martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf.

The example implementation provided here evaluates a simplified version of the conditions for receiving "MÃ¸drekvote", a small subset of the overall parental leave. 


The evaluation can be visualized in D3 too!<img width="1323" alt="nare" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/214156/30643386-fa4fa8ea-9e0e-11e7-9ea4-1ca3e4c53173.png">
